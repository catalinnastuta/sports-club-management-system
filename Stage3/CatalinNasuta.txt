I have created the following classes with the methods:
-AddCompetition
-AddStaff
-Competition
-CompetitionFile
-DisplayStaff
-EditCompetition
-EditStaff
-RemoveCompetetition
-RemoveStaff\
-ShowCompetitionInformation
-Staff
-StaffFile 

I also created half of the menu, the part of the classes I created. 

Dominic and I, we both worked on the UML diagram.

I also created the Brief User Guide with Dominic's help.

Besides, I also did the readme.txt on how to compile and run the program.

I submitted and uploaded all the work on the GitHub repository.
