I have created the following classes along with the methods used in them:
AddClientToMembership
AddNewClient
Client
ClientFile
DisplayClientInformation
EditClientInformation
Membership
MembershipFile
Person
RemoveClient
RemoveClientFromMembership
ShowMembershipTiers

I have also edited the StaffFile to utilize person as a inheritance same with ClientFile.

I have also created a good portion of the main menu.
I have created the main menu of having the main choices Client, Membership, and Exit along with the client menu and membership menu. I also created the premade staff and clients that will be utilized in the program as examples. I also added the private static for ClientFile and MembershipFile along with the scanner systems.

I also have helped with preplanning out the design of the program along with initial UML but Catalin made majority of UML's and finalized them all.

I also test ran the program multiple times to ensure that what was edited and added works with everything else and does not break the program.
