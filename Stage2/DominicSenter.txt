What I have done is created the entire menu layout with the different option selections. From there those options will either have sub options that will do specifics of what the user wants out of the program or do exactly what was mentioned from the option selection. From there the options selected will connect to the method selections that was created by Hunter to display the data and output the user is wanting or to be able to have access to the arrays I have implemented to add clients with memberships, clients to classes and competitions. So practically I created the whole user function side of the program interface with the menus and their capabilities of to be able to have access to methods to add/change/create based off the options selected. Hunter created the more internal functions of the program that is being designed to allow it to function.
